## 🔥 What is Roastify?

**Roastify** is your brutally honest, no-sugarcoating resume reviewer that roasts your CV — but with purpose.  
We go beyond the jokes and ego-shattering one-liners. **Roastify** is a unique blend of humor + helpfulness.

🪓 First, we roast you...  
💡 Then, we guide you.

## 💼 Why Roastify?

Let's face it — feedback is either boring or way too kind. That’s not helpful.

But *imagine this*:
- You upload your resume.
- An AI roastmaster tears it apart (funny or serious mode).
- Then, it gives you **actionable suggestions**, **skill gap analysis**, AND **free resources** to level up. 🔥📈

No more vague advice. No more guesswork.
